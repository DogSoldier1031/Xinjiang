Xinjiang

A report on the “forced labor” accusations and some particularly interesting passages:

“Regarding ASPI’s comment about Uyghur workers speaking limited Mandarin, it begs the question that if ASPI saw this as isolation and abuse of vulnerability issues, why then did it have a problem with Uyghur workers attending Mandarin classes after work? Here, ASPI wedged Taekwang Shoes into another “damned if they do, damned if they don’t” situation.”

—-Perfectly captures a favorite method of western propaganda, demonize the “enemy” no matter what options they choose.

“Regarding ASPI’s first sub-concern, it is noted that, if the factory did indeed have an office called “psychological dredging office”, this would be very worrisome. However, 心理疏导室 is figuratively understood in Mandarin as ‘psychological counselling office’. Given that the lead author, Ms Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, is a native Mandarin speaker, it is likely this Orwellian translation was intentional so that it would taint the references to “heart-to-heart talks”, “psychological consulting” and “uplifting of the ‘innate quality’ of the Uyghur workers” that came afterwards. Thus, it is submitted that this was a bad-faith translation for the purpose of sensationalism. Putting the mistranslation aside, the fact is that many large businesses and institutions around the world provide counselling services for their workers; it does not mean anything untoward is occurring, especially without actual evidence of it.”

——Tactical Mistranslation is another favorite, plays into the public’s xenophobia knowing most will never bother to look for other viewpoints or translations.

—-Another method is to paint mundane things as nefarious.  Mandarin classes for minorities in China is just their version of ESL education, but Sinophobes just see another opportunity to demonize.  Schools with barbed wire and police patrols are seen in many major U.S. cities, but when China does it it’s “re-education camps,” conveniently ignoring the fact that the region had many ETIM attacks (a group labeled terrorists, and bombed in Afghanistan, by the U.S. until Trump removed them from the list.) yet it’s ok to take these measures to protect people from everyday city violence in the western world.

Also, some good reading (from western sources) on Xinjiang and the many misunderstandings surrounding it, especially around the battle against Islamist violence in the region and it’s lasting effects today:

Plus, it is laughable to pretend the U.S. and Europe (who have been colonizing, bombing, sanctioning, conducting coups, etc. against large swathes of the Muslim world for generations) somehow care more than the Muslim majority nations themselves:

Beyond hatred and anger - after the successful campaign against terrorism and Islamism, according to the will of Beijing, the conditions in Xinjiang should return to normal
